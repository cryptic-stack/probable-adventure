Expected behavior: Notice that cat has printed the contents of the errorout file and in this case the tail utility cannot open a file at /var/log/mylog because a file or directory in this path does not exist (the file mylog , in this example). Now, we will use cat and redirection to create a file. If you do not give the cat command a file to print it will just read from the keyboard. Redirect what you type to a file and put a few words in it for the next step. Enter "" cat > ~/testinput "" and press Enter . The prompt should have moved down a line. You can now enter text that will be placed in the testinput file. Enter ""cabbage"" and press Enter . Enter ""xerox"" and press Enter . Enter ""tiger"" and press Enter . Enter ""apple"" and press Enter and then press Ctrl + c .

Lab 12 Q15 - Learn bash history shortcuts,"### Lab 12: History

Difficulty: **Intermediate**

Task: Learn bash history shortcuts

Expected behavior: Looks like we need to use sudo to read the file. Luckily, there are a few shortcuts we can use so that we don't need to retype the whole command. Bash will replace "" !! "" with the last command you entered, so you can run sudo !! to run the previous command as sudo. If you ran a command after that command, you can run sudo !-2 . The "" -2 "" means to replace it with the command run two commands ago. If you run "" history "", you will notice a number before each command. Bash will replace "" !<history_number> "" with the corresponding command in history. Lastly, you can run sudo !cat and Bash will replace !cat with the last command that began with cat . Use any of these methods to run the previous command with sudo . Enter ""student"" as the password.

Expected behavior: Let's say we wanted to look at RSA key file. The command would be the same as the previous except "" ecdsa "" would be replaced by "" rsa "". Bash has a shortcut for this. Without running any other commands, run "" ^ecdsa^rsa "". If you do run a different command, you can use the Up arrow to repeat the "" sudo cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key "" command again.

Task: End of the command history recall

Expected behavior: Let's say we wanted to use add the -R option to list the directory recursively but remove the -a option that shows hidden files. Bash allows us to grab either the first, the last, or all of the last command using ""!!:"" followed by ""^"", ""$"", ""*"", respectively. You can also use a number to specify the argument, i.e., !!:3 will grab the third argument of the last command. Run "" ls -R !!:$ "" without running another command. If you do run another command, use the Up arrow to run the previous command again.

Add the Sticky Bit permission to the RandD directory by entering "" chmod 1770 /RandD "". The SUID permission has a default value of 4, the SGID has a default value of 2, and the Sticky Bit has a default value of 1. The 1 in the 1770 is turning the Sticky Bit permission on for the RandD directory.

Lab 34 Q06 - Try out one of the different uptime options,"### Lab 34: System Administration

Difficulty: **Expert**

Task: Try out one of the different uptime options

Expected behavior: Do you know the last time your system was rebooted? The uptime command has a couple of useful options to see how long a system has been up. One of these is the -s option. This shows you the system uptime since date/time. There is also the -p option to make it pretty. Try one of them now.

Difficulty: **Expert**

Task: What's a banner anyways?

Expected behavior: You all know that banner that is required when you login via SSH ? Yep, the one the lawyers and auditors (i.e., that is us sometimes!) say that you have to have on your system when you login. You can set that now! Use nano to modify the /etc/issue.net file and place your message inside.

"Lab 34 Q08 - Making a banner, part deux","### Lab 34: System Administration

Difficulty: **Expert**

Task: Making a banner, part deux

Expected behavior: That is the first step, now you need to modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file using the following sed one-liner command: sudo sed -i ""s/#Banner none/Banner \/etc\/issue\.net/g"" /etc/ssh/sshd_config . This command will search the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file for "" #Banner "" and replace it with "" Banner /etc/issue.net "" without ever opening the file. This is a functionality of sed, an in-place modification of a file. The Banner portion of the sshd_config file points to a file anywhere on the file system that you want to use as a banner.

Lab 34 Q10 - Restart the SSH daemon to record changes,"### Lab 34: System Administration

Difficulty: **Expert**

Task: Restart the SSH daemon to record changes

Expected behavior: Now, in order for the change to actually occur, you will need to restart the SSH daemon. This requires a little more knowledge about process control in the flavor and kernel version of Linux you are using. This lab was booted with upstart (init) and not systemd. Since it was booted in this fashion, you cannot use systemctl to control services. You will need to perform the following command to start the SSH service: sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start

Lab 34 Q12 - Get me all the LOGS!,"### Lab 34: System Administration

Difficulty: **Expert**

Task: Get me all the LOGS!

Expected behavior: Sometimes you need to export log files off of your file system so that you can parse them on a clean system. This often happens in incident response activities. Change directory into your /var/log directory and create a logs.tar.gz file with all of your *.log files in the /var/log directory and place it in your /home/student directory.
